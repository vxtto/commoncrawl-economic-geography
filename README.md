# Using CommonCrawl in Economic Geography
This repository contains the code from the semester project _CommonCrawl for economic geography data analysis: identifying cross-sectoral firms_.
It should be used as reference for researchers outside computer science to explore the CommonCrawl web archive as a data source.

## Contents
The repository contains 
- Jupyter Notebooks: Both are commented but not executable as-is. Users are invited to adapt the code to their needs.
- `requirements.txt` file to download the required python packages.
- `/data` folder containing an ISIC division csv for processing.
